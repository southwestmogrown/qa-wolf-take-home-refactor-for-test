/**
 * utils/retry.js
 * Generic async retry with exponential backoff.
 */

/**
 * Calls fn() up to `attempts` times. If fn() rejects, waits `delayMs`
 * milliseconds before the next try, doubling the delay each time
 * (exponential backoff). If every attempt fails, the last error is re-thrown.
 *
 * @param {() => Promise<any>} fn           - The async operation to retry
 * @param {object}             options
 * @param {number}             options.attempts       - Total number of tries (including the first)
 * @param {number}             options.delayMs        - Delay before the first retry (ms)
 * @param {number}             options.backoffFactor  - Multiplier applied to delay after each failure
 * @param {(attempt: number, totalAttempts: number, error: Error, waitMs: number) => void} [options.onRetry]
 *   Optional callback invoked before each retry.
 *   Any error thrown by onRetry is swallowed so it does not mask the real failure.
 * @returns {Promise<any>} Resolves with fn()'s return value on the first success
 * @throws  {Error}        If fn is not a function, or if any config option is invalid
 * @throws  {Error}        The last error thrown by fn() if all attempts are exhausted
